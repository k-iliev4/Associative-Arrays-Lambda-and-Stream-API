//Write a program that keeps the information about students and their grades.
//On the first line, you will receive number n. After that, you will receive n pair of rows. First, you will receive the student's name, after that, you will receive his grade. Check if the student already exists and if not - add him. Keep track of all grades for each student.
//When you finish reading data, keep students with an average grade higher or equal to 4.50.
//Print the students and their average grade in the format:
//"{name} â€“> {averageGrade}"
//Format the average grade to the 2nd decimal place.
